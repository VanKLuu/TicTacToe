# Build a Tic-Tac-Toe Game Engine With an AI Player in Python

This is a companion project to a Real Python [tutorial](https://realpython.com/tic-tac-toe-ai-python/) about implementing a game engine using the minimax algorithm as rudimentary artificial intelligence. It consists of two elements:

1. Game Engine Library
2. Game Front Ends

---
### Installing through the CMD line
Before proceeding, make sure you've created a virtual environment, activated it, and installed the tic-tac-toe game engine library into it:

```shell
$ cd tic-tac-toe/
$ python -m venv venv/
$ source venv/bin/activate
(venv) $ python -m pip install library/
```

## Game Front Ends

There are a few game front ends implemented in separate packages for you to try out. Before running them, make sure you've followed the earlier steps just described. Now, change the directory to the game front ends parent folder:

```shell
$ cd tic-tac-toe/frontends/
$ python play.py
